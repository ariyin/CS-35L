Using git branch, we can see that in ~eggert/src/github/git, we have five branches: maint, master, next, seen, and todo. There's an asterick next to master, indicating that we're currently on the master branch.

For our own cloned git directory, we only have one branch, master, that we are also currently on.

The reason for this difference is because the repository I cloned only clones the main branch by default, while ~eggert/src/github/git has other branches inside the repository.
