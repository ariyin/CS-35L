5. The chmod program changes permissions on a file. What does the symbolic mode u+sx,o-w mean, in terms of permissions?

u+sx: grants the user special mode permissions in execute mode, enabling them to execute the file with root user permissions

o-w: revokes write permissions for users who are not the file owner or members of the file’s group, preventing other users from writing to the file

u+sx,o-w: multiple symbolic modes can be specified by separating them with commas; this combination grants the user special execute permissions and removes write permissions for others
